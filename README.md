USB & Expansion<br>5. Audio & Video<br>6. Custom<br>7. Help & Info  | https://github.com/Avnet/MaaXBoard-RT-V3--GUI-Guider-Demo
| MaaXBoard-RT out-of-box demo | Showcases the functionality of the MaaXBoard-RT board.<br>Note: Refer to GUI-Guider-Demo for GUI page editing. | https://github.com/Avnet/MaaXBoard-RT-V3--GUI-Demo|
| MaaXBoard-RT GUI Demo Lite | A simplified version of the out-of-box demo with only three screens.<br>This repo also include the GUI Guider project used to generate the screens. | https://github.com/Avnet/MaaXBoard-RT-V3--GUI-Demo-Lite|
| MaaXBoard-RT-V3--WebServer-Demo | This program utilizes the m7, m4 cores to demonstrate headless webserver on the i.mxrt1170 MCU and demonstrates multiple features:<br>- Hyperflash as configuration storage<br>- Wi-Fi softAP or Wi-Fi client<br>- HTTP server based on lwip stack<br>- Use of m7, m4 cores. inter-core communication<br>- IMU, distance sensor reading using i2c bus.| https://github.com/Avnet/MaaXBoard-RT-V3--WebServer-Demo|
| MaaXBoard-RT-V3--Peripheral_HT | Application demonstrating the BLE Peripheral role, except that this application specifically exposes the HT (Health Thermometer) GATT Service.<br>Once a device connects, it will generate dummy temperature values. | https://github.com/Avnet/MaaXBoard-RT-V3--Peripheral_HT |
|MaaXBoard-RT-V3--Tensorflow-Lite|TensorFlow Lite model-based implementation of object detector configured to run on MaaXBoard RT Rev 3.|https://github.com/Avnet/MaaXBoard-RT-V3--Tensorflow-Lite|
|MaaXBoard-RT-V3--Maestro-Demo|A multi-core project demonstrating Voice Intelligent Technology (VIT) from NXP along with several extra features.<br>This demo consists of 2 projects residing on the M7 and and M4 cores.|https://github.com/Avnet/MaaXBoard-RT-V3--Maestro-Demo-M7<br> https://github.com/Avnet/MaaXBoard-RT-V3--Maestro-Demo-M4|
|MaaXBoard-RT-V3--VIT-Demo-Lite|VIT lite-version demo is the FreerTOS project has voice control, record, audio playback functionalities. On the recorded samples, triangular dithering, dynamic compression algorithm are applied in real time as to minimize audio clipping and minimize audio quality loss during conversion from 24bit to 16bit.|https://github.com/Avnet/MaaXBoard-RT-V3--VIT-Demo-Lite|
